         <h1>About Us</h1>
         <p>
         <b>Our Cafe is the peak of urban and hip culture. </b>We serve and cater to all sentient beings as well as non-sentient beings. Part of being a popular and well known Cafe comes many customers. We constantly have lines out of the door at Cabbage Head Cafe. All of our ingredients are farm fresh. This means only the best dairy in your soy latte. Not only do we have the best ingredients we are a family friendly establishment. The worst you'll have to worry about visiting our Cafe are all the trendy and chic hipster customers!
         </p>
         <p>
         <b>For ages we have had one goal in mind.</b> Making good coffee and serving it to the people. As long as coffee beans grown we will be serving the all holy bean water. While the average Joe or Jane may suit for for a dunkin or a starbuck our customers prefer only the best. Our customer base has actually named themselves 'coffee snobs' due to the fact that they like coffee that tastes a little better than average. It's incredible how much a little bit difference in taste can change an ego. Cheers to only the best coffee!
         </p>
         <p>
         <b>Our friendly staff is always to serve.</b> Serving our customers is what our staff does best. Do not let the tattoos and piercings get to you. When a member of our staff says 'be right with you' this means after they complete an irrelevant conversation with another staff member. The goes beyond customer first ideology if you think about it. We like to make each and every member our staff as comfortable as possible. If you encounter one in front our store front smoking, please do not bother them. Again, we're a family oriented business and can <i>not</i> wait to serve you and yours!
